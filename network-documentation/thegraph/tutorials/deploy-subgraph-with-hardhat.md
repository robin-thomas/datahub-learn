# Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need to have a basic understanding of Ethereum, Solidity, and the NodeJS ecosystem.

# Requirements

- You will need Metamask installed in your browser. You can install it from <https://metamask.io/>
- You need to have a recent version of Node.js installed. We recommend using v14.17.6 LTS for compatibility.

Topics covered in this tutorial:

- Deploying the smart contract to Rinkeby testnet using Hardhat
- Creating a subgraph in the Subgraph Studio
- Downloading the contract abi and then creating a subgraph from it
- Deploying the subgraph to Subgraph Studio

# Project setup

Run the below commands to install the npm dependencies globally. These are required to build and deploy your subgraph.

```text
npm i -g yarn
npm i -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

Run the below commands to create new directory called `vendingMachine`, create a new npm package inside it, and then install hardhat.

```text
mkdir vendingMachine
cd vendingMachine
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

Then run:

```text
npx hardhat
```

You shall get the below output:

```text

Welcome to Hardhat v2.6.4

? What do you want to do? …
▸ Create a basic sample project
  Create an advanced sample project
  Create an empty hardhat.config.js
  Quit
```

Select `Create an empty hardhat.config.js` with your keyboard and hit enter key.

It shall create a `hardhat.config.js` file in the root of `vendingMachine` directory, with the below content:

```javascript
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.7.3",
};
```

Run the below command to install few hardhat plugins necessary to compile and deploy your contract:

```text
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle
```

# Writing the smart contract

Create a new directory called `contracts` inside `vendingMachine` directory, and create a file inside it called `VendingMachine.sol`.

Paste the below solidity code into that file.

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.7.3;

contract VendingMachine {

    // store the oener of this smart contract
    address owner;

    // A mapping is a key/value store. Here we store cupcake balance of this smart contract.
    mapping (address => uint) cupcakeBalances;

    // Events are necessary for The Graph to create entities
    event Refill(address owner, uint amount, uint remaining, uint timestamp, uint blockNumber);
    event Purchase(address buyer, uint amount, uint remaining, uint timestamp, uint blockNumber);

    // When 'VendingMachine' contract is deployed:
    // 1. set the deploying address as the owner of the contract
    // 2. set the deployed smart contract's cupcake balance to 100
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        cupcakeBalances[address(this)] = 100;
    }

    // Allow the owner to increase the smart contract's cupcake balance
    function refill(uint amount) public onlyOwner {
        cupcakeBalances[address(this)] += amount;
        emit Refill(owner, amount, cupcakeBalances[address(this)], block.timestamp, block.number);
    }

    // Allow anyone to purchase cupcakes
    function purchase(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value >= amount * 0.01 ether, "You must pay at least 0.01 ETH per cupcake");
        require(cupcakeBalances[address(this)] >= amount, "Not enough cupcakes in stock to complete this purchase");
        cupcakeBalances[address(this)] -= amount;
        cupcakeBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
        emit Purchase(msg.sender, amount, cupcakeBalances[address(this)], block.timestamp, block.number);
    }

    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner callable");
        _;
    }
}

```

# Compiling the smart contract

To compile the smart contract, run:

```text
npx hardhat compile
```

You shall get the below output:

```text
Compiling 1 file with 0.7.3
Compilation finished successfully
```

The smart contract has been compiled successfully.

# Deploying the smart contract

To deploy to `Rinkeby` Ethereum testnet, you need to add a `network` entry to your `hardhat.config.js` file.

```javascript
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

// Replace this with your Alchemy api key
const ALCHEMY_API_KEY = "YOUR ALCHEMY_API_KEY";

// Replace this private key with your Rinkeby account private key
const RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY = "YOUR RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY";

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.7.3",
  networks: {
    rinkeby: {
      url: `https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/v2/${ALCHEMY_API_KEY}`,
      accounts: [`0x${RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY}`],
    },
  },
};
```

To get your `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`, go to <https://www.alchemyapi.io>, and signup for an account.

![Create your Alchemy app](../../../.gitbook/assets/alchemy_create_app.png)

Fill in the details like shown above.

Then choose the free plan.

![Choose Alchemy Free plan](../../../.gitbook/assets/alchemy_plan_free.png)

To get your `RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY`, open your browser and open Metamask. Make sure **Rinkeby Test Network** is selected. Go to Account details, and click on `Export Private Key`.

**Never ever share your private key with anyone!**

Create a directory called `scripts`, and paste the below code into a new file `deploy.js` inside scripts directory.

```javascript
async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

  console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

  console.log("Account balance:", (await deployer.getBalance()).toString());

  const VendingMachine = await ethers.getContractFactory("VendingMachine");
  const vendingMachine = await VendingMachine.deploy();

  console.log("Contract address:", vendingMachine.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```


Finally, run:

```text
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

You shall get the below output:

```text
Deploying contracts with the account: <YOUR RINKEBY WALLET ADDRESS>
Account balance: <YOUR RINKEBY WALLET BALANCE>
Contract address: <YOUR RINKEBY SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS>
```

Yay! You just deployed your smart contract successfully to Rinkeby testnet!

We will need the smart contract address later.

# Creating the graph project in Subgraph Studio

First, you will want to head over to the Subgraph Studio at <https://thegraph.com/studio/>.

![Login to Subgraph Studio](../../../.gitbook/assets/graph_connect.png)

Click on the **Connect Wallet** button. Choose a Metamask wallet to login with. Once you are authenticated, you shall see the below screen, where you can create your first subgraph.

![Create your first subgraph](../../../.gitbook/assets/graph_create_subgraph.png)

Next, you need to give your subgraph a name. Give the name as **vending**. Once that's done, you will see this screen:

![Subgraph dashboard](../../../.gitbook/assets/graph_subgraph_created.png)

On this screen, you can see details about the subgraph like your deploy key, the subgraph slug and status.

# Creating and deploying your subgraph

Run the following command to create the subgraph by downloading the contract ABI from the Rinkeby testnet. A new directory called vending will be created, and all node dependencies will be installed automatically.

```text
graph init --contract-name VendingMachine --index-events --studio --from-contract <YOUR RINKEBY SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS> --network rinkeby vending
```

Replace `<YOUR RINKEBY SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS>` with your deployed VendingMachine smart contract address.

Output:

```text
✔ Subgraph slug · vending
✔ Directory to create the subgraph in · vending
✔ Ethereum network · rinkeby
✔ Contract address · <YOUR RINKEBY SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS>
✔ Fetching ABI from Etherscan
✔ Contract Name · VendingMachine
———
  Generate subgraph from ABI
  Write subgraph to directory
✔ Create subgraph scaffold
✔ Initialize subgraph repository
✔ Install dependencies with yarn
✔ Generate ABI and schema types with yarn codegen

Subgraph vending created in vending

Next steps:

  1. Run `graph auth` to authenticate with your deploy key.

  2. Type `cd vending` to enter the subgraph.

  3. Run `yarn deploy` to deploy the subgraph.

Make sure to visit the documentation on https://thegraph.com/docs/ for further information.
```

Run the following command to set the deploy key. Replace <DEPLOY_KEY> with the key you got from <https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/vending/>

```text
graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
Deploy key set for https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/
```

To create the subgraph, run the following command. Your new subgraph will be created in a `subgraph.yaml` file.

```text
cd vending
graph codegen && graph build
```

This will generate a build directory under `vending/build`.

**Output:**

Deployed to https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/vending

Subgraph endpoints:
Queries (HTTP):     https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/8676/vending/v1.0.0
Subscriptions (WS): https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/8676/vending/v1.0.0
```

Subgraph Studio might take few minutes to sync the graph from the Rinkeby testnet. Wait until the syncing process is complete.

Once the sync is complete, you can access the subgraph on the Playground to run your queries.
